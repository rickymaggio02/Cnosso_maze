# Cnosso_maze
Welcome to Cnosso maze, a new rogue game written in c language.
To move your character (k) around the map you need to enter one of the wasd direction commands, in order to reach the goal (o).
During your journey in the maze, you will find different monsters (m); the fight system is very simple and based on the tradizional game (sasso- carta- forbice) -> (s - c -f).

Good luck.
